# Open Transport

An open provider of public transportation data all over the world.

![Stage: Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage-Development-informational?style=flat)

## What we provide

- Static transportation data &mdash; route information, stop locations, and more.
- Real-time transportation data &mdash; service changes and vehicle locations.
- Predictions based on network analysis &mdash; arrival times, etc.
- Passenger journey planning.

Our goal is to make public transportation more easily available and convenient.

## Our principles

- **We're open**. We allow our data to be used by anyone, and most of the source code is freely available.
- **We don't hide any data**. This includes vehicle identifiers, vehicle location updates time, etc.
- **We center on community contributions**. Anyone can propose changes and vote on them.
  
## Where our data comes from

- **Local transportation authorities**. Usually they only provide real-time coordinates of transport vehicles.
- **Community**. Our users have the ability to propose and vote on changes to most of the data.
- **Algorithms**. We try our best to predict arrival times, adjust vehicle locations and more.

## Honorable mentions

Thanks to [HSL](https://www.hsl.fi/en/) for providing amazing and open informational services
for their Helsinki transportation system.

## Alternatives and their downsides

### [Yandex Maps](https://yandex.ru/maps)

- They are not open.
- Their focus is not on the public transportation services.
- They hide a lot of information, only showing moving icons on a map.
- They use a proprietary prediction algorithm, which doesn't work that great.

### [Bustime](https://busti.me/)

- They claim to be open, but they only provide data to their front-end applications,
  not the public, and their GitHub repository wasn't updated since 2015.
- Their data is only corrected by local administrators, not the community.
- Their mobile application lacks features present on their website and vise versa.
- They don't strive to innovate.
